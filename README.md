# UNHackTheVOTE 2017

Please review our [rules of conduct](https://github.com/thursdaynetwork/Hackathon_Gerrymandering/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md) and let's unhack the problem of Gerrymandering.

- [Election Statistics, 1920 to Present](http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/)
