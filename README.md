# UNHackTheVOTE 2017

Please review our [rules of conduct](https://github.com/thursdaynetwork/Hackathon_Gerrymandering/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md) and let's unhack the problem of Gerrymandering.

This repo contains formatted district boundaries, census demographics, and election data for the following states:

- Michigan
- Ohio
- Texas

We've sourced this data from:

- [The Harvard Election Data Archive](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/eda?q=&types=dataverses%3Adatasets&sort=dateSort&order=desc&page=1)
- [Election Statistics, 1920 to Present](http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/)
-TIGER Congressional District Boundaries from the Census (https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php)



### Project ideas

- [OpenElections](http://docs.openelections.net/) - scrape data and contribute
- Congressional Demographics + District Boundaries
  - Visual analysis
- Election Results
  - Use merged State Legislative Data &  Election Data GeoJson files
  - Run database analysis 
    - Python or R
  - Network analysis
    - Graph databases - Neo4J
  - R visualization
  - Calculate Efficiency Gap
  - Algorithm to identify gerrymandering
